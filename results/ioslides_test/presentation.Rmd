## A note on this presentation

* This presentation was constructed using Rstudio's ioslides output from RMarkdown 
* To view in presenter mode: add '?presentme=true' to the URL and be sure to allow pop-ups
* To view presenter notes, hit 'p' (sometimes this doesn't work properly, presenter mode is a more reliable way to see speaker notes)

## The Survey

* Fire Service Survey
* 5458 Records (respondents)
* Year unknown, post 2011 (per Q5)

```{r gvis, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(googleVis)
library(shiny)
respondents_by_state = survey_dt[,.N, .(state)]

G <- gvisGeoChart(respondents_by_state, "state", "N",
                  options=list(region="US",

## Suggestions for Improvement to survey

* Migrate to electronic survey platform
* Questions prompting numeric responses unnecessarily broken out into ordinals
* Some questions poorly binned, resulting in skipped ranges and requiring "other" category
* Inconsistent binning choice across similar questions
* Inconsistent null representation
* Numbers as text (comma separated)

<div class="notes">
* Questions prompting numeric responses unnecessarily broken out into ordinal variables reduces data granularity
    * Number of buildings with 3+ stories (Q3)
    * Minimum staffing (Q7-Q10)
* Some questions poorly binned, resulting in skipped ranges and requiring "other" category
    * Firefighter fitness (Q22d/f)
* Inconsistent binning choice across similar questions
    * Hazmat training level prompts for precise percentages
    * Other types of training ask respondent to check a box representing a range
    
Migrate to electronic survey platform
* Minimize errors from multiple human data-entry steps
* Automatic data integrity checks (e.g. percents add up to 100)
* Ensure necessary questions are not left blank

* Inconsistent null representations
    * Empty cells
    * '#NULL!'
    * NA
    * White space
* Columns out of order
    * Column order should align with ordering in survey
    * At first glance, it appears that Q31 is incomplete, and Q32-46 and all of PART VIII are missing

Cleaning Nulls

* For the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that null entries on questions asking for numeric values are equivalent to a reponse of "0"
* Cleaning in this fashion had the additional effect of creating a new "null" category on questions associated with categorical/ordinal variables, since categories are otherwise 1-indexed in the data
* Normally I would advise performing this kind of cleaning operation on a variable-by-variable basis. Broad strokes are dangerous, but time was limited in this analysis.  

Large numeric values used xx,xxx comma delimiting

* Forces coersion to text
* Necessitates otherwise unnecessary data cleaning step
* Fewer characters for data entry = less work for data entry personnel

Cleaning Numbers

* Stripped commas prior to numeric coersion, being careful to avoid stripping 
  commas from text columns

## FINDINGS

* Staffing levels (paid) are stable for most departments, but have changed significantly for others
* Women have stronger representation in volunteer departments
* The apparatus fleet is aging

## Staffing levels

52% of departments have no full-time paid personnel. Of those that have paid personnel, relative to 2011: 

* 18% experienced a staffing decline
* 25% experienced a staffing increase
* 57% experienced no net change to staffing

```{r ecdf, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
ecdf_fn = ecdf(survey_dt[q6>0 & q6!= net_personnel_change, perc_personnel_change])

gg <- ggplot(survey_dt[q6>0& q6!= net_personnel_change], 
             aes(100*(perc_personnel_change-1), 100*ecdf_fn(perc_personnel_change))) +
        geom_line() +
        #stat_ecdf(geom='line') +
        #geom_text(color='red', size=3, label=round(yv,2), aes(x=2, y=yv), hjust=1, vjust=0) +
        #geom_vline(color="red", xintercept = 2, linetype = "longdash") +
        #scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,2,4,6,8,10)) +
        xlim(-150,150) +
        labs(x="% Personnel Change (Paid)",
             y="Cumulative Percent of Depts w/Paid Personnel",
             title="Net change to paid staffing since 2011"
             )

gg + clean_theme()
```


## Representation of Women

* Controlling for department size, women have higher representation in volunteer departments
* 21% of volunteer departments had at least 14% female staff, whereas only 1% of paid departments did.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
intercept <- -coef(mod_prob)['(Intercept)'] / coef(mod_prob)['female_ff']
slope     <- -coef(mod_prob)['total_ff'] / coef(mod_prob)['female_ff']

gg <- ggplot(all, aes(total_ff, female_ff)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=categ), alpha=0.3) +
  geom_abline(slope=slope, intercept=intercept, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(0,2000) +
  ylim(0,250) +
  labs(x="Total Firefighters", y="Female Firefighters", 
       title="Representation of Women in the Fire Service")

gg<-gg + clean_theme() + theme(legend.position="right")
  
gg+geom_text(x=1000, y=150, angle=39, 
            label="y = 0.144 x - 8.17",  fontface=3, size=3)
```

<div class="notes">

* Relative effect on odds ratio of female_ff vs total_ff: 7x

```
    is_volunteer_dept ~ total_ff + female_ff

             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
(Intercept)  1.641406   0.061250   26.80   <2e-16 ***
female_ff    0.200858   0.012611   15.93   <2e-16 ***
total_ff    -0.028968   0.001392  -20.81   <2e-16 ***
```  

*Model Validation*

* Bootstrapped accuracy: 77.0% (95% CI: 75.3% - 78.7%), 
* p < 0.005 (permutation test)
* Area Under ROC Curve: 0.84


* 2000 bootstrap iterations, found to give same results as 200 iterations
* 200 Target shuffling iterations over 200 bootstrap iterations


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
roc_df = data.frame(xv=perf@x.values[[1]], yv=perf@y.values[[1]])

gg <- ggplot(roc_df, aes(xv, yv)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, linetype=2) +
  labs(x="False Positive Rate",
       y="True Positive Rate",
       title=paste0("Logistic Regression Performance: ROC curve (AUC: ",round(auroc@y.values[[1]],2),")"))

gg + clean_theme() + theme(legend.position="right")

```


</div>


## Aging Fleet

* \> 46% of stations are running apparatus that is 15+ years old

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gg <- ggplot(melted, aes(age, 100*value)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = variable), position = "dodge", stat="identity") +
  labs(title="Age of In-Service Apparatus",
       x="Age", y="Percent of Departments")
gg + clean_theme() + theme(legend.position="right")
```

<div class="notes">
* 46% is just a lower bound. This is the value associated with tankers (0-14), the lowest value in the (0-14) category. Because the set of depts running old tankers is unlikely to be a strict superset of departments running old engines or ladders, the percent of departments running any kind of old unit is almost certainly higher. Needs further analysis.

*Future work*

* Dig deeper into varaibles associated with departmental needs
* Be more careful with null data
* Play with free text fields
